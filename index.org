    during building (using packages).  

  - Select ‘yes’ on the next window. Do you want to delete all windows
    related files from the CD.

  - Select ‘yes’ on the next window. Do you want to generate a hybrid
    image(ISO/USB).

  - Your new iso image will be created in
    ~/tmp/remaster­new­files/livecd.iso 
    Click OK to start the process.

  - Then also install firefox, with following command on the terminal 
                   "apt­get install firefox" 

  - Now we need to install the flash plugin in firefox. Download the
    file "install_flash_player_11_linux.x86_64.tar.gz" from official
    adobe’s website or from any site hosting it.

  - Then extract the files from above .gz file. So from the directory
    where ‘libflashplayer.so’ file is located, copy it to
    ~/tmp/remaster­root/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/
  [[./5.png][Screen shot5]]

  - Now we have apache, php, firefox and flash installed in our
    CD. Next we need to copy the labs to ~/tmp/remaster­root/var/www/
    and check for the read, write and execute permissions on the labs
    being copied.  Else change them to 775 by using below command 
    "chmod 775 ­R cse01/"

  - After copying all the required labs, exit from the terminal. Which
    will bring you to following window, select continue building and
    press OK

  Your livecd.iso will be created and you can find it in ~/tmp/remaster­new­files 
** Create Bootable Pendrive from ISO
  - To create the bootable pendrive from above iso.
  - Insert a 8 GB USB stick and start the unetbootin tool.
  - And select your customized image i.e. livecd.iso.
  - rest of the steps are self explanatory.
